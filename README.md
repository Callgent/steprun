# ð‘¢¡teprun.ai

`Steprun.aiâ€‹â€‹` sandboxes your AI-generated code into step-by-step REPL sessions, with the following benefits:

- **Escape if-else hell** â€“ Focus on the current execution path only, skipping exponential branching complexity.
- **Debug line by line** â€“ Catch and fix errors instantlyâ€“line by line, no post-hoc tracing.
- **Declare now, implement later** â€“ Define function stubs first, fill logic only when called (like human iterative coding).
- **Hibernate & restore** â€“ Persist sessions mid-execution, ideal for long-running processes and iterative workflows.
